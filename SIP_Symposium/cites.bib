abstract = {Super-resolution reconstruction produces one or a set of high-resolution images from a set of low-resolution images. In the last two decades, a variety of super-resolution methods have been proposed. These methods are usually very sensitive to their assumed model of data and noise, which limits their utility. This paper reviews some of these methods and addresses their short-comings. We propose an alternate approach using L1 norm minimization and robust regularization based on a bilateral prior to deal with different data and noise models. This computationally inexpensive method is robust to errors in motion and blur estimation and results in images with sharp edges. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its superiority to other super-resolution methods.},

abstract = {We address the image denoising problem, where zero-mean white and homogeneous Gaussian additive noise is to be removed from a given image. The approach taken is based on sparse and redundant representations over trained dictionaries. Using the K-SVD algorithm, we obtain a dictionary that describes the image content effectively. Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database. Since the K-SVD is limited in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image. We show how such Bayesian treatment leads to a simple and effective denoising algorithm. This leads to a state-of-the-art denoising performance, equivalent and sometimes surpassing recently published leading alternative denoising methods.},

abstract = {â€”The challenge of image interpolation is to preserve spatial details.We propose a soft-decision interpolation technique that estimates missing pixels in groups rather than one at a time. The new technique learns and adapts to varying scene structures using a 2-D piecewise autoregressive model. The model parame- ters are estimated in a moving window in the input low-resolution image. The pixel structure dictated by the learnt model is enforced by the soft-decision estimation process onto a block of pixels, in- cluding both observed and estimated. The result is equivalent to that of a high-order adaptive nonseparable 2-D interpolation filter. This new image interpolation approach preserves spatial coher- ence of interpolated images better than the existing methods, and it produces the best results so far over a wide range of scenes in both PSNR measure and subjective visual quality. Edges and textures are well preserved, and common interpolation artifacts (blurring, ringing, jaggies, zippering, etc.) are greatly reduced.},

@article{Yang2010,
abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to single-image super-resolution, based on sparse signal representation. Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation, we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input, and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches, we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low resolution and high resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore, the sparse representation of a low resolution image patch can be applied with the high resolution image patch dictionary to generate a high resolution image patch. The learned dictionary pair is a more compact representation of the patch pairs, compared to previous approaches, which simply sample a large amount of image patch pairs [1], reducing the computational cost substantially. The effectiveness of such a sparsity prior is demonstrated for both general image super-resolution and the special case of face hallucination. In both cases, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar SR methods. In addition, the local sparse modeling of our approach is naturally robust to noise, and therefore the proposed algorithm can handle super-resolution with noisy inputs in a more unified framework.},

abstract = {Super resolution image reconstruction allows the recovery of a high-resolution (HR) image from several low-resolution images that are noisy, blurred, and down sampled. In this paper, we present a joint formulation for a complex super-resolution problem in which the scenes contain multiple independently moving objects. This formulation is built upon the maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework, which judiciously combines motion estimation, segmentation, and super resolution together. A cyclic coordinate descent optimization procedure is used to solve the MAP formulation, in which the motion fields, segmentation fields, and HR images are found in an alternate manner given the two others, respectively. Specifically, the gradient-based methods are employed to solve the HR image and motion fields, and an iterated conditional mode optimization method to obtain the segmentation fields. The proposed algorithm has been tested using a synthetic image sequence, the "Mobile and Calendar" sequence, and the original "Motorcycle and Car" sequence. The experiment results and error analyses verify the efficacy of this algorithm.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a single image super-resolution and enhancement algorithm using local fractal analysis. If we treat the pixels of a natural image as a fractal set, the image gradient can then be regarded as a measure of the fractal set. According to the scale invariance (a special case of bi-Lipschitz invariance) feature of fractal dimension, we will be able to estimate the gradient of a high-resolution image from that of a low-resolution one. Moreover, the high-resolution image can be further enhanced by preserving the local fractal length of gradient during the up-sampling process. We show that a regularization term based on the scale invariance of fractal dimension and length can be effective in recovering details of the high-resolution image. Analysis is provided on the relation and difference among the proposed approach and some other state of the art interpolation methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method has superior super-resolution and enhancement results as compared to other competitors.},
